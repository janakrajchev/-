    In The Beginning There Was Light is a documentary film by Austrian director
    P. A. Straubinger on the subject of inedia. Straubinger visits several people who
    supposedly nourish themselves with "light" and tries to find possible explanations on how inedia might work.
    P. A. Straubinger researched inedia for ten years. This led to the film’s production, which took five years.
    The film premiered on May 13, 2010 at the Cannes Film Festival.[3] "In The Beginning There Was Light"
    was shown all over the world and became one of the most successful feature documentaries in Austrian cinema
    history.[4] (Shamelessly stolen from Wikipedia.)

    Due to its commercial success, especially in the German speaking countries, "In The Beginning There Was Light"
    was discussed in the mainstream media on a broad basis and received enthusiastic acclaim as well as harsh criticism.
    [27][28] In the talk show "Menschen bei Maischberger" in Germany´s National Television Das Erste [29]
    and two TV-discussions in the Austrian National Television ORF critics warned that the film could motivate
    people to stop eating.[30] Director P.A. Straubinger explained that this would be a complete
    misunderstanding of his film. He repeatedly stated that he does not want to motivate anybody to stop eating but he
    would advocate eating consciously without asserting any particular nutritional ideology.(Also shamelessly stolen from Wikipedia.)
